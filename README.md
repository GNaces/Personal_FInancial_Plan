# Personal Financial Plan

Personal Financial Plan is a Python terminal application that runs on the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

It is an organized strategy to manage your funds on a monthly basis. Individuals who consistently adhere to a personal monthly financial plan can gain control of their finances, achieve their financial goals, and strive toward long-term financial security and independence.

Here is the live version of my project.

## Conception

- My initial step was to draw a flow diagram of my scope for the Personal Financial Plan concept.

- The Personal Financial Plan lets users keep track of their monthly income and expenses. It allows you to imput revenue, add expenses with description and categories, view a budget summary, and store the data to a file for reference.

## Setup of Gitpod Workspace and resources

I made use of Code Institutes "Love Sandwiches Walkthrough Project", "Getting Set Up" course videos for the following:
 - [Creating a Google Sheet](https://youtu.be/4MWpwuPpSCA).
 - [To activate API credentials](https://youtu.be/WTll5p4N7hE).
