# Personal Financial Plan

Personal Financial Plan is a Python terminal application that runs on the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

It is an organized strategy to manage your funds on a monthly basis. Individuals who consistently adhere to a personal monthly financial plan can gain control of their finances, achieve their financial goals, and strive toward long-term financial security and independence.
